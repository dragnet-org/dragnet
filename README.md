dragnet
=======
Dragnet isn't interested in the shiny chrome or boilerplate dressing of a 
webpage. It's interested in... 'just the facts.'

Dragnet will be published and presented at the 22nd International World Wide Web Conference
(WWW 2013).  See the paper
<a href="https://github.com/seomoz/dragnet/blob/master/dragnet_www2013.pdf">here.</a>
The `update_201211` branch contains the code from the paper and additional documentation
on the data set.

Running
-------
Each of the algorithms is implemented as a class of static methods that can be
imported from the top level of dragnet, and implement a method `analyze`, which 
accepts a string of HTML and returns a string representative of the content.


Fill a directory `documents` with per-site folders of the HTML sources of 
documents from that site, and then `run.py` will iterate through each of the 
input files and produce a corresponding file in `output` with just the content.
For example,

    documents/
        wired.com/
            latest-higgs-rumors
        seomoz.org/
            8-attributes-of-content-that-inspire-action

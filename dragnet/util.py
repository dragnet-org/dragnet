The Levenshtein distance code was originally taken from (retrieved June 21, 2012):
   http://mwh.geek.nz/2009/04/26/python-damerau-levenshtein-distance/

It may eventually be updated to use different scores for insertions, deletions,
transpositions, etc. For the time being, however, it remains as presented in
the article.

    This distance is the number of additions, deletions, substitutions,
    and transpositions needed to transform the first sequence into the
    second. Although generally used with strings, any sequences of
    comparable objects will work.

    Transpositions are exchanges of *consecutive* characters; all other
    operations are self-explanatory.

    This implementation is O(N*M) time and O(M) space, for N and M the
    lengths of the two sequences.

    2
    >>> dameraulevenshtein('fee', 'deed')
